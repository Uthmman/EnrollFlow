## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#4A8FE7) to evoke trust and stability in financial transactions.
- Background color: Light blue (#EBF2FA), almost white, creates a clean and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant green (#70CA7A) to highlight successful actions and important notifications, analogous to blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear, readable text throughout the application. Its neutral, modern aesthetic provides legibility in forms and receipts.
- Use simple, clean line icons to represent form fields and payment options. Icons should be consistent in style and size.
- Maintain a clean, well-organized layout with clear sections for each step of the registration process. Use white space effectively to prevent overcrowding.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback to the user during form submission and payment processing. Avoid excessive animations that could distract from the task at hand.
